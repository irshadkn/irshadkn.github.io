            We provide excellent photo realistic pencil portraits from photographs of people and pets drawn from a photograph supplied by you. Drawings from photos will make a great personalised gift for any occasion, such as Diwali, Christmas ,Birthdays, Valentine’s Day, Anniversaries, Weddings, Mother’s Day or Father’s Day. The quality and clarity of the photo will influence how much detail we can include. Therefore, a clear and focused photo will allow us to create a realistic pencil portrait. We can only draw what we see, therefore if the details are blurry or of low quality, the pencil portraits will reflect this. High-resolution photos are preferable – the higher the better.<br>
            If you will be taking a photo, please use a good camera or the latest phone/tablet cameras. Photos taken outside in daylight is preferable, close to your subject and at eye level. We can also take people or pets from individual photos and combine them to create a group or family portrait. Drawings from photos are sprayed with gloss varnish which forms a colourless glass clear coating to prevent smearing and smudging.
