								<p style="text-align:justify;">Business cards are cards bearing business information about a company or individual. They are shared during formal introductions as a convenience and a memory aid. A business card typically includes the giver's name, company or business affiliation (usually with a logo) and contact information such as street addresses, telephone number(s), fax number, e-mail addresses and website. Before the advent of electronic communication business cards might also include telex details. Now they may include social media addresses such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Traditionally many cards were simple black text on white stock; today a professional business card will sometimes include one or more aspects of striking visual design.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<img src="images/animation.png" width="100px">
								<p style="text-align:justify;">Whiteboard animation is a process where a creative story and storyboard with pictures is drawn on a whiteboard or something that resembles a whiteboard by artists who record themselves in the process of their artwork. It is used in TV and internet advertising to communicate messages in a "unique" way. The term "whiteboard animation" comes from the process of someone drawing on a whiteboard and recording it. The actual effect is a time-lapse, or sometimes stop-motion. Actual animation is rarely used but has been incorporated. Other terms are "video scribing" and "animated doodling". These video animation styles are now seen in many variations, and have taken a turn into many other animation styles. We can help you become immediately productive using video in every element of your organization and life. Ask about our training, creative, branding, animation and other services. We’ll put you ahead of the crowd! </p>
